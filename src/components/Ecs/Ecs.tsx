                    <p>As the technical director I facilitated and organized a team of technicians to design immersive effects elevating guest experience. By collaborating with the creative team, the technical team was able to develop and execute to ensure the vision aligned with the overall theme. Also, we innovated and integrated new equipment for animatronics, lighting effects to captivate our over 500 guests</p>
